# Parameters
parameters: Parameters
parameters.invalid: 'Invalid parameter : {input}'
parameters.enable_strict_mode: Enable strict mode
parameter.no_description: No description provided.
parameter.description.allowoldsave: >
  Allows save games with older save game versions to be loaded with only a tooltip warning, instead of blocking them altogether.
  Especially useful for testing shortly after increasing the save game version, since recent save games will still be loadable and relevant.
parameter.description.autosave: Overrides the autosave interval in the user's settings.txt file.
parameter.description.autosave_count: >
  Overrides the debug_saves count in the user's settings.txt file. Specifies how many autosave files are kept before the oldest one is deleted when creating a new one.
parameter.description.checksum: >
  Computes and writes out the overall checksum and the checksum of each individual game data file to logs/system.log.
  Useful when trying to identify if there is a modification to a single file, or some other file that exists but shouldn't, throwing off the checksum and blocking multiplayer.
parameter.description.crash_data_log: >
  Collects data on errors based on crashes that occur with critical bugs and malfunctions. Including if a buggy mod is activated from the launcher.
parameter.description.debug: >
  Indicates that the game is running in debug mode, enabling a variety of extra behavior to help with development or testing.
  Can be turned on from the game console using the debug command. Disables multiplayer.
