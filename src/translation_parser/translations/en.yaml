# Parameters
parameters: Parameters
parameters.invalid: 'Invalid parameter : {input}'
parameters.enable_strict_mode: Enable strict mode
parameter.no_description: No description provided.
parameter.description.allowoldsave: >
    Allows save games with older save game versions to be loaded with only a tooltip warning, instead of blocking them altogether.
    Especially useful for testing shortly after increasing the save game version, since recent save games will still be loadable and relevant.
parameter.description.autosave: Overrides the autosave interval in the user's settings.txt file.
parameter.description.autosave_count: >
    Overrides the debug_saves count in the user's settings.txt file. Specifies how many autosave files are kept before the oldest one is deleted when creating a new one.
parameter.description.checksum: >
    Computes and writes out the overall checksum and the checksum of each individual game data file to logs/system.log.
    Useful when trying to identify if there is a modification to a single file, or some other file that exists but shouldn't, throwing off the checksum and blocking multiplayer.
parameter.description.crash_data_log: >
    Collects data on errors based on crashes that occur with critical bugs and malfunctions. Including if a buggy mod is activated from the launcher.
parameter.description.debug: >
    Indicates that the game is running in debug mode, enabling a variety of extra behavior to help with development or testing.
    Can be turned on from the game console using the debug command. Disables multiplayer.
parameter.description.dump_script_doc: Dumps a JSON file containing the structured documentation for scripts.
parameter.description.hands_off: >
    Automatically starts a 1936 game as Uruguay, unpaused, running at maximum speed, with human AI turned on.
    Additional effects include enabling the AI testing, test logs, and view, disabling the end screen, and disabling frame smoothing.
parameter.description.historical: >
    Forces the historical focus gameplay setting on or off.
    Only works in conjunction with any auto-start option, like -hands_off or -start_tag.
    Default value in game is -historical=yes, so only -historical=no has any real effect currently.
parameter.description.human_ai: Turns human AI on, so that even the country that the player is controlling is managed by AI.
parameter.description.logpostfix: >
    Prepends the provided text to the beginning of log file names.
    Useful when running multiple instances of the game on a single machine, such as for multiplayer testing.
parameter.description.logprefix: >
    Appends the provided text to the end of log file names.
    Useful when running multiple instances of the game on a single machine, such as for multiplayer testing.
parameter.description.nofilewatcher: >
    Turns off the file watcher which observes game folders and reloads databases or UI when files change.
    Off by default in Release, but turned on by -debug.
parameter.description.nolauncher: Skips the launcher and resumes the last game with the previous mods loaded. Has no effect with this launcher.
parameter.description.start_minimized: >
    Starts the application minimized to the taskbar. Only available in Debug and Release_D. Only implemented on Windows at the time of writing.
parameter.description.start_save: Skips the main menu and directly loads a save file (specified by file name but without the ".hoi4" extension).
parameter.description.start_speed: Sets the initial speed of the game (0-4).
parameter.description.start_tag: Skips the main menu and directly starts a 1936 game as the country specified by TAG.
